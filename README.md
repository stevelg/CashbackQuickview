# CashbackQuickview
View available cashback offers for the current website without leaving the page

"Cashback Quick View" is a simple Chrome extension that aims to help users quickly determine if they can earn cashback while shopping online.

## Key Feature:

Cashback Indicator: The extension adds a small icon or badge to the Chrome browser toolbar that displays the cashback percentage or amount available for the current website. The icon updates in real-time based on the user's preferred cashback platform (e.g., Rakuten, Honey).
How it works:

When a user visits an online store, the extension automatically checks if the store is supported by the selected cashback platform.
If cashback is available, the extension displays the cashback percentage or amount as a small icon or badge in the Chrome toolbar.
Clicking on the icon opens a tooltip or a pop-up window that provides more details about the cashback offer, including any terms and conditions or restrictions.

## Benefits:

Convenient Information: Users can quickly see if a website offers cashback without needing to search for the information manually or leave the current page.
Increased Awareness: The extension helps users become more aware of cashback opportunities, encouraging them to make more informed purchasing decisions.
Time and Money Savings: By easily identifying cashback opportunities, users can maximize their savings without spending additional time searching for cashback offers.
